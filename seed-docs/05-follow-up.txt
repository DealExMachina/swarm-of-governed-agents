FOLLOW-UP — BOARD BRIEFING PACK (EXCERPT)

Prepared for the November board meeting.

Revenue and outlook
- Q3 revenue $2.1M (15% YoY). Full-year guidance unchanged at $8.5M–$9.0M.
- We have revised our hiring target from 20 to 15 engineers for Q4 to reflect market conditions and prioritisation. This is a refinement, not a strategic pivot; we will revisit capacity in Q1.

Contradiction resolution
- Earlier external messaging ("20 engineers") and internal stretch goal are now aligned: we communicate "15+ hires" externally and track 20 as an internal stretch. No retraction issued; next earnings call will use the updated figure.

Risks highlighted for the board
- Regulatory: one open item on access recertification ahead of SOC 2; expected to close before audit.
- Execution: APAC Nexus delay may shift some Q4 revenue into Q1; overall year unchanged.

No new assumptions or goals beyond those already in the strategy memo and product brief.
