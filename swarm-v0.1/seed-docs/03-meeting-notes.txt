MEETING NOTES — PRODUCT & ENGINEERING SYNC

Attendees: J. Walsh (CEO), M. Webb (CFO), Eng VP, Product Lead
Date: 2024-10-22

Nexus rollout
- APAC launch delayed by 2–3 weeks due to localisation and compliance review. New target: mid-November. No change to revenue assumptions for the year; Q4 upside may shift to Q1.

Hiring
- 8 offers out; 3 accepted. Goal of 20 by year-end is still stated but internally we are tracking to 15 as the realistic stretch. Engineering will prioritise security and compliance roles first.

Audit
- SOC 2 audit scheduled for week of Nov 11. Access recertification completed. No other blockers reported.

Action: Align external messaging (earnings, press) with "15+ hires" to avoid contradiction with earlier "20 engineers" commitment. Internal goal remains 20; we will report progress transparently.
